## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON ISSUES & QUICK FIXES

### Issue: Database won't connect
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql  # Linux
brew services list  # Mac
# If not running:
sudo systemctl start postgresql  # Linux
brew services start postgresql  # Mac
```

### Issue: Backend shows "Module not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: Hedera errors
**Fix:**
1. Double-check Account ID format: `0.0.xxxxx`
2. Verify Private Key starts with `302e020100`
3. Check account has HBAR (visit https://hashscan.io/testnet/)
4. Try with NFT minting disabled first

### Issue: IPFS upload timeout
**Fix:**
1. Check Infura project status
2. Verify Project ID and Secret are correct
3. Try smaller file first (< 10MB)
4. Check internet connection

### Issue: CORS error in browser
**Fix:**
```javascript
// In backend/server.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*',  // For development only
  credentials: true
}));
```

### Issue: Frontend shows blank page
**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API_URL in .env
3. Check backend is running
4. Clear browser cache
