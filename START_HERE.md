## 🎯 YOUR EXACT STEPS

### Step 1: Read YOUR_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md
Open `YOUR_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` and follow it line by line.

### Step 2: Get Your Accounts
- PostgreSQL (local install)
- Hedera testnet account (free)
- Infura IPFS account (free)

### Step 3: Configure Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp env.example .env
# Fill in .env with your account details
npm run migrate
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Backend
Visit: `http://localhost:4000/health`
Should see: `{"success": true, "message": "BeatHive API is running"}`

### Step 5: Start Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd ..
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Connect Them
- Create `src/config/api.js` (instructions in SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Update `src/store/useStore.js` to use real API
- Test wallet connection

### Step 7: Test Everything
- Connect wallet → Check database
- Browse artists → Should show real data
- Upload track → Check IPFS and database
- View dashboard → See real stats

### Step 8: Deploy & Win!
- Deploy backend to Heroku
- Deploy frontend to Vercel
- Record demo video
- Submit to hackathon
- WIN! 🏆
